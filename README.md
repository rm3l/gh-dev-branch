> GitHub CLI extension to generate branch names off of issues.

This is a simple extension that helps generate names for branches as soon as you want to start working on a given issue.

Think of it as the CLI counterpart for the beta feature of development branches that can be created in the GitHub UI,
as documented here: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue 

## Installation

- Install the `gh` CLI. See [https://github.com/cli/cli#installation](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) for further details.
- Install the extension:

```bash
gh extension install rm3l/gh-dev-branch
```

## Usage

```bash
‚ùØ gh gh-dev-branch -h

Usage: gh dev-branch <issue> [options]
Options: 
  -repo string
        repository to use for finding the issue
```

## Working with the source code

- If not done already, download and install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) to build the project. This project has been built with Go 1.18.
- Clone the repository and install the local version.

```bash
cd dev-branch

# Install the local version
gh extension install .

# At this point, you can start using it
gh dev-branch <my-issue-number>

# To see changes in the code as you develop,
# simply build and use the extension:
go build && gh dev-branch <my-issue-number>
```
